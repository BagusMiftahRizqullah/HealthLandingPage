A GMC-registered clinician will review your full medical history to decide if it is appropriate for you."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"How is Mounjaro taken?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Mounjaro is given as a once-weekly injection using a pre-filled pen. Your care team will provide clear instructions and support so you feel confident using it safely."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"What side effects should I be aware of?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Common side effects can include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation and reduced appetite. Serious side effects are less common but can occur. You will receive full safety information and should contact the team urgently if you feel unwell."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Can I stop Mounjaro once I reach my goal weight?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"Any decision to reduce or stop treatment should be made together with your clinician. They will help you plan how to maintain your results with lifestyle support as treatment is adjusted."}},{"@type":"Question","name":"Will I definitely receive a prescription?","acceptedAnswer":{"@type":"Answer","text":"No. Prescription is never guaranteed.
